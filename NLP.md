Natural Language Processing 

Vectorization: convert words to individual features with either a binary or frequency based value
Embedding: convert words to a dense vector representation from a pre-trained separate process

NLP: AI, ML, computational linguistics for text and voice data, find sentiment etc. Analyze intent 
Cleaning & preprocessing text to reduce typos, removing unimportant words, parsing text into meaningful words and sentences, converting text to numeric 
computing degree of association among documents, drawing structural and systematic learning 

Preprocessing Text with three methods
: Scan text in each example, parse out, create data matrix of mapping for token

1. Lemmatization: reduce feature set size
2. Make n-grams: bi-gram or triogram, add feature set along with words, capture nuances/sentiment, increase features 
3. Remove stop words: 'stop word' belongs to pre-specified language-specified set, dominant frequency > K

Binary = binary presence of tokein in document 
count = count of token in document 
TF-IDF: if token appears in given document, importance to document goes up
