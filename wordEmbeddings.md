Words with similar semantic meanings will have word embedding vectors with high cosine similarity 

How do we know when to use word embeddings vs. TF-IDF? 
One thing to consider is the size of the vocabulary and frequency of words. 
For a small vocabulary full of high-frequency words, TF-IDF is a good choice. 
For larger vocabularies full of low-frequency words, word embeddings are a good choice.
